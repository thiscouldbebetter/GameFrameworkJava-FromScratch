GameFrameworkJava-FromScratch
=============================

The code in this repository implements a rudimentary game framework in Java.

It is intended to be merged with the GameFrameworkJava repository,
which was ported from TypeScript (or possibly even from JavaScript).
That other repository isn't fully implemented, because it's been difficult
to figure out how to get it working after porting. This repository is
intended to make that easier.

Running
-------

Open a command prompt in the Source directory, and run these commands:

> javac *.java

> java GameFrameworkDemo
